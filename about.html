                <h1>About RSI</h1>
                <p>About RSI:

                    Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) is a common condition that can significantly impact your daily life, especially if you spend long hours working at a computer or performing repetitive tasks. At ErgoWijzer, we understand the challenges that RSI presents, and we're here to help you overcome them.
                    
                    RSI occurs when repetitive movements, awkward postures, or prolonged periods of static positioning lead to discomfort, pain, and potentially debilitating symptoms. These symptoms may include stiffness, weakness, numbness, tingling, and loss of coordination in affected muscles and joints.
                    
                    The good news is that RSI is preventable and manageable with the right knowledge and resources. ErgoWijzer is dedicated to providing you with the information and products you need to create a healthier and more ergonomic work environment. By making simple adjustments to your workspace and incorporating ergonomic solutions, you can reduce the risk of RSI and alleviate existing symptoms.
